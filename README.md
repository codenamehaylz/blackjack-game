#### The popular card game, without the cards.


## Description

This project started off as a coding bootcamp challenge, which was to create a very simple blackjack game played through browser alerts. Now I am updating the game to be played on the web page rather than through annoying pop ups.

The aim is to keep the game minimal and simple. Keeping the logic of the card game but ditching the cards and casino elements.

:construction: This is not the finished product. The game is functional but not pretty!

## How to play
Get as close to 21 as you can without going over. 
You start with two numbers, and the option to 'hit' or 'stay'. Press 'hit' to be dealt a random number between 2-11, mimicking the value of the cards in the real game. Once you 'stay', the dealer will be dealt their numbers. Whoever is closer to 21 wins.
